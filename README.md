# Hospital-Readmission-Prediction-Project

## Objective
To develop a predictive model that identifies patients at high risk of extended hospital stays (high Length of Stay - LOS) based on their demographic and clinical attributes. The goal is to enable proactive care, optimize resource allocation, and minimize readmission rates using a fully automated and scalable workflow with Power BI, Python, and SQL integration.

## Problem Statement
Hospital overcrowding and resource strain often stem from unanticipated long patient stays. There is a need to predict patients likely to stay longer than average, using historical data, and present the insights to stakeholders in an interactive dashboard with real-time updates.

## Data Sources
- Health_care_patient_Dataset.csv – Includes patient demographics, medication adherence, appointments, etc.
- Python-generated Predicted_Output.csv – Contains prediction results.
- Stored in SQL Server and connected to Power BI.
